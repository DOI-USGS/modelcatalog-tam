    "subTitle": "A Program to Simulate Turbulent or Laminar Groundwater Flow Conditions",
    "summary": "The conduit flow process for MODFLOW-2005 (CFP) has the ability to simulate turbulent or laminar groundwater flow conditions by:  coupling the traditional groundwater flow equation with formulations for a 1-dimensional discrete network of cylindrical pipes (Mode 1, CFPM1), inserting a high-conductivity flow layer that can switch between laminar and turbulent flow (Mode 2, CFPM2), or simultaneously coupling a discrete pipe network while inserting a high-conductivity flow layer that can switch between laminar and turbulent flow (Mode 3, CFPM3).  Conduit flow pipes (CFPM1) may represent:  large dissolution features, such as submerged caves in carbonate aquifers or large voids from dissolution of burrowed carbonate rock; voids in fractured [...]",
