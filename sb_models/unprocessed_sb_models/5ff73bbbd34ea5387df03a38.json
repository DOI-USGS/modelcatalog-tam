    "subTitle": "A FORTRAN IV VERSION OF WATEQ, A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR CALCULATING CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM OF NATURAL WATERS",
    "summary": "WATEQF is a FORTRAN IV computer program that models the thermodynamic speciation of inorganic ions and complex species in solution for a given water analysis. The original version (WATEQ) was written in 1973 by A. H. Truesdell and B. F. Jones in Programming Language/one (PL/1). With but a few exceptions, the thermochemical data, speciation, activity coefficients, and general calculation procedure of WATEQF is identical to the PL/1 version. This report notes the differences between WATEQF and WATEQ, demonstrates how to set up the input data to execute WATEQF, provides a test case for comparison, and makes available a listing of WATEQF.",
