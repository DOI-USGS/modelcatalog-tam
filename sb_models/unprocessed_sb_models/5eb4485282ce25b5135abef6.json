BLTM results are within the accuracy required by most water-quality studies. The BLTM is easily applied to unsteady flows in networks of one-dimensional channels with fixed geometry and tributary inflows. Reaction kinetics for up to 10 constituents are provided in a user-written decay-coefficient subroutine. Postprocessor plot programs improve the utility of the model. The model routes any number of interacting constituents through a system of one-dimensional channels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Release Date</strong> <em>(Date model was originally released (MM, YYYY))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>02, 1995</p>\n\n<p><strong>Last Update</strong> <em>(Date of last update (MM, YYYY))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>11, 1996</p>\n\n<p><strong>Organization(s)</strong> <em>(Organization(s) that produced, funded, or partnered on the creation of this model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>USGS</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mission Area</strong> <em>(USGS mission area with which this model most clearly aligns. <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/science/mission-areas\">https://www.usgs.gov/science/mission-areas</a>)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Water Resources</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong> <em>(Resources (how to use the model, where to download it, related publications, other webpages about the model (in other catalogs), USGS webpage)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Jobson, H.E., and Schoellhamer, D.H., 1993, Users manual for a branched Lagrangian transport model Water-Resources Investigations Report 87-4163, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/wri874163\">https://doi.org/10.3133/wri874163</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Schoellhamer, D.H., and Jobson, H.E., 1986, Programmers manual for a one-dimensional Lagrangian transport model: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 86-4144, 101 p.</p>\n\n<p>Schoellhamer, D.H., and Jobson, H.E., 1986, Users manual for a one-dimensional Lagrangian transport model: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 86-4145, 95 p.</p>\n\n<p>Jobson, H.E., 1997, Enhancements to the Branched Lagrangian transport modeling system: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 97-4050, 57 p.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Image</strong> <em>(URL for an image that best represents the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model Type</strong> <em>(process-based model, mathematical model, application model, deterministic model, stochastic model, mechanistic model, empirical model, conceptual model, if other please explain)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Mathematical model</p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> <em>(All software and/or hardware requirements needed to run the model and replicate any published results)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"BLTM and DAFLOW are written in Fortran 77 with the following extensions: include files and variable program names longer than 6 characters. wdaflow uses the UTIL, ADWDM, and WDM libraries from LIB.
