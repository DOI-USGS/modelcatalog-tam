To compile BRANCH the LIBUTL utility library is required. LIBUTL includes software/user, software/computer, software/data base, and software/graphics interaction routines. BRANCH graphics are coded using CalComp graphics calls. The LIBUTL software provides graphics libraries to convert CalComp graphic references to Graphical Kernel System (GKS) library references and Interactive Software Services's INTERACTER library references. BRANCH memory requirements depend on array dimensioning parameters found in the dimens.cmn include file. The memory requirements can be tailored to suit application needs and computer system memory constraints by modifying the parameters in the dimens.cmn file and then recompiling the code. Generally, the program is easily adapted to most computer systems that have access to the LIBUTL software and one of the mentioned graphics libraries. The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and DOS-based 386 or greater computers having a math coprocessor and 4 mb of memory.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Equations</strong> (What are the equations of the model?):</p>\n\n<p>\"The BRANCH model uses a weighted four-point, implicit, finite-difference approximation of the unsteady-flow equations. Flow equations are formulated, using water level and discharge as dependent variables, to account for nonuniform velocity distributions through the momentum Boussinesq coefficient, to accommodate flow storage and conveyance separation, to treat pressure differentials due to density variations, and to include wind shear as a forcing function. The extended form of the de Saint Venant equations is formulated so as to provide a high degree of flexibility for simulating diverse flow conditions produced by varied forcing functions in channels of variable cross-sectional properties. Subdivision of branches into segments of unequal lengths is accommodated by the finite-difference technique and the implicit solution scheme permits computations at large time steps. The effects of hydraulic control structures within the model domain are treated by a multi-parameter rating method. The model accommodates tributary inflows and diversions as well as lateral overbank flows, and includes a Lagrangian, particle-tracking scheme for conservative constituents. Transformation equations are formulated that describe the relationship between unknowns at the ends of branches thereby reducing the order of the coefficient matrices and producing a significant saving of execution time and computer memory. The resultant matrix of BRANCH-transformation and boundary-condition equations is solved by Gaussian elimination using maximum pivot strategy.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Input/Output and Variables</strong> <em>(Key input parameters and their values and domain ranges and units (minimum input requirements for model operation and default values, where appropriate); control variables; Key output variables and domain ranges)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Input data consist of channel geometry and initial flow conditions defined at all cross-section locations and boundary conditions defined at channel extremities. Cross-sectional data, in the form of tables of top-width and area as functions of water level, describing the open-channel reaches can be manually prepared and formatted for input to the model or interactively entered, processed, and formatted using the Channel Geometry Analysis Program (CGAP). Initial flow conditions can be measured, assumed, or interpolated values. Boundary conditions can be specified by equation, functional relations, or time-series values. Time series of boundary conditions, i.e., water levels or discharges, can be input directly via formatted sequential files or automatically retrieved from the data base of either the TDDS or the WDM system. Input values can be either in metric or inch-pound units.</p>\n\n<p>Time series of computed flow results can be directly output in tabular or graphical form at all, or selected, cross-section locations. Tabular output options include discrete flow results at every time step or iteration; daily summaries of minimum, maximum, and average flow conditions; monthly flow-volume summaries; or river-mile locations of injected particles. Digital or line-printer graphical options include hydrograph plots of computed water levels or discharges or comparative plots of computed results versus measured data. Graphical plots can be produced on CRT devices, directly, and (or) in CGM, PostScript, or HPGL formatted files for postprocessing. Computed results can be stored directly in text files or in the data base of either the TDDS or WDM. Interfaces are available for the USGS/WRD National Water Information System (NWIS) and the Branched Lagrangian Transport Model (BLTM). Output results can be either in metric or inch-pound units.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Conditions</strong> <em>(Initial conditions)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Flow equations are formulated, using water level and discharge as dependent variables, to account for nonuniform velocity distributions through the momentum Boussinesq coefficient, to accommodate flow storage and conveyance separation, adn to treat pressure differentials due to density variations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Functions</strong> <em>(Forcing functions that affect the dynamics of the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Flow equations are formulated, using water level and discharge as dependent variables to include wind shear as a forcing function.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?branch</a></p>\n",
