    "subTitle": "An unsteady, one-dimensional, open-channel flow model",
    "summary": "FOURPT is a numerical model for simulating unsteady, one-dimensional flow in networks of open channels. Options particularly useful in training or prototyping include selection of governing equations (kinematic, diffusion, or dynamic), boundary-value perturbation, and user-programmable constraint equations. The model can simulate non-trivial concepts, such as flow in complex interconnected channel networks, meandering channels with variable effective flow lengths, hydraulic structures defined by unique three-parameter relations, and density-driven flow. Channel geometry may be rectangular, trapezoidal, or irregular depending upon which of three channel-property modules is linked with the program.",
