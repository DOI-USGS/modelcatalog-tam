A mixture can be a natural result of convergence of flow lines to a discharge area such as a spring or stream, or it can be an artifact of sampling a long-screen well. TRACERMODEL1 contains a worksheet that can be used to determine hypothetical concentrations of atmospheric environmental tracers in water samples with several different age distributions. It is designed to permit plotting of ages and tracer concentrations in a variety of different combinations to facilitate interpretation of measurements. TRACERMODEL1 includes several different types of graphs that are linked to the calculations.
