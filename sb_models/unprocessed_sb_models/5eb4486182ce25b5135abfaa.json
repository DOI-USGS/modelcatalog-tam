Copy the VFLUX toolbox folder (\u201cvflux\u201d) into a folder on the MATLAB search path, such as \u201cMy Documents\\MATLAB\u201d in Windows environments. Alternately, the location of the vflux folder can be added to the search path by typing addpath('C:\\examplefolder\\vflux') at the MATLAB command prompt. The MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox must be installed, and the Captain Toolbox folder (\u201ccaptain\u201d) must also be added to the MATLAB search path. The Captain Toolbox can be downloaded from the following web site: <a href=\"http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/cres/captain\">http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/cres/captain</a>. If the Signal Processing Toolbox is not available, then a private \u2018resample\u2019 function may be used. This function can be downloaded along with VFLUX from the above web site, and must be copied to a folder called \u201cprivate\u201d within the VFLUX toolbox folder (\u201cvflux\u201d). The MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) may also need to be installed; see the readme file included with the private resample function for more information. There are two functions in the toolbox that can be directly called by the user, VFLUXFormat (vfluxformat) and VFLUX (vflux). These functions are executed by typing their commands at the MATLAB command prompt, and can also be called by external functions or scripts, allowing them to be integrated into your custom workflow. VFLUXFormat is used to format and (optionally) synchronize multiple time series, where the data already exist in some form as variables in the MATLAB workspace. VFLUXFormat is called first, in order to prepare the data structure for use with VFLUX. VFLUX is then called to perform the resampling, filtering, and flux calculation routines on the formatted data structure. Descriptions of the inputs and options for the two functions are presented below, and can also be displayed in the MATLAB command window by typing help vfluxformat and help vflux at the command prompt.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Content/vflux2.zip/vflux2/vflux2/VFLUX 2 Documentation/2.

Table 1 contains example time series data collected from a vertical temperature profile. The time series data include a column of sample times, in days, and a column for each sensor of temperature values, in degrees Celsius, that were recorded at each sample time. The sample time values must be evenly-spaced in time and monotonically increasing throughout. For example, the data excerpted in Table 1 were sampled every 10 minutes without exception. Any gaps in time that occurred during data collection must be filled by interpolation. The time series data must be imported as array variables into the MATLAB workspace, either as individual column vectors or as a single large matrix. In the event that different sensors were sampled on different time schedules or for different lengths of time, then there must be a separate time series for each of the schedules. For example, if sensors 1, 2 and 3 were sampled on schedule A and sensors 4 and 5 on schedule B, then there would be two time columns, A and B, the first associated with temperature columns for sensors 1, 2 and 3, and the second with temperature columns for sensors 4 and 5. It is very important to note that VFLUX can only be used to analyze a raw dataset in which a strong periodic temperature signal exists (typically the diurnal, 24-hour signal driven by solar input) for a length of time long enough to filter the signal and discard the edge effects (see Flux Results section, below). This typically means at least one week of continuous time series data containing a 24-hour temperature signal.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Content/vflux2.zip/vflux2/vflux2/VFLUX 2 Documentation/3.
