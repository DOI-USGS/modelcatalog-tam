    "subTitle": "Finite-element surface-water modeling system for two-dimensional flow in the horizontal plane",
    "summary": "FESWMS-2DH is a modular set of computer programs that simulates two-dimensional, depth-integrated, surface-water flows. FESWMS-2DH consists of an input data preparation program (DINMOD(1)), flow model (FLOMOD(1)), simulation output analysis program (ANOMOD(1)),and graphics conversion program (HPPLOT(1)). The programs have been developed to analyze flow at bridge crossings where complicated hydraulic conditions exist, although they may be applied to many types of steady or unsteady flow problems. Shallow rivers, flood plains, estuaries, and coastal seas are examples of surface-water bodies in which flows may be essentially two-dimensional in the horizontal plane.",
