Historical landscape reconstructions also require a wealth of historical data such as agricultural census data, demographic and population data, wetland data, reservoir construction dates, and more.</p>\n\n<p>For future projections, FORE-SCE uses a scenario-based framework. Those projections can be simple extrapolations (a \"\"business-as-usual\"\" scenario) from past land cover trends, which can be derived from USGS land cover databases. However, more complex scenarios are typically derived from exogenous sources, such as integrated assessment modeling efforts associated with IPCC scenarios.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Installation</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Information on how to install the model so that it can be run (e.g., compilation and/or execution instructions))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"1. Install Python 3.5 or greater 2. Use pip to install dependencies from the requirements file 3. Run the model from the command line. A web-based user interface is also available for internal USGS FORE-SCE users.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version Updates</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Changes since the last version (if the model is an update) including bug fixes, new features, or other substantive modifications, where appropriate)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Updates to growth-class pixel selection process. New process employs stochastic selection to mirror initial class conditions and used efficient weighted random selection method to prioritize potential pixels based on suitability values.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions</strong>&nbsp;<em>(What are the key assumptions made that define the dynamics of the model?)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"FORE-SCE has a heavy focus on the demands on the landscape from anthropogenic forces, with an assumption that demand for anthropogenic land uses such as urban lands, agricultural land, mining, forestry activity, etc. drives overall landscape pattern. The model thus focuses heavily on representing demand for anthropogenic land uses, with the configuration/structure of the \"\"rest\"\" of the landscape (natural vegetation classes such as grassland, shrubland, forest, etc.) dependent on anthropogenic land use demand.</p>\n\n<p>FORE-SCE also represents natural vegetation change in response to projected changes in climate. Those changes represent hypothetical vegetation change without consideration of potential impacts of invasive species, changes in disturbance regimes, or land management. \"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Model structure: provide a flow diagram of the model. (e.g. [Growing Degree Days since Jan 1]+[Warm Spells]=[Leaf Out Day of Year] and [Growing Degree Days since Leaf Out Day of Year]+[Warm Spells]=[Bloom Day of Year]))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>See 'Data and Tools':&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/eros/lulc/data-tools\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183);\">https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/eros/lulc/data-tools</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Equations</strong>&nbsp;(What are the equations of the model?):</p>\n\n<p>\"As an empirical / statistical modeling framework, land cover change prescriptions are supplied through scenarios based on \"business-as-usual\" extrapolations of existing landscape trends, or more complex socioeconomic scenarios that have historically come from a variety of sources, each with their own modeling approach. FORE-SCE allocation of modeled land cover change on the landscape is accomplished via statistically guided allocation procedure weighted by category suitability and subject to configuration restrictions such as age constraints and protected areas.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Information</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Temporal resolution, time stepping, and units)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"User selected, but based on yearly land cover outputs. Past applications have been on 1- or 10-year time increments.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spatial Information</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Spatial dimensionality, resolution, extent, grid type if relevant)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"FORE-SCE is flexible in modeled spatial extent and resolution. Spatial extent for past products has ranged from single ecoregions or watersheds, up to national scale (conterminous US) historical backcasts and future projections. The model provides pixel-based output, with past modeled products ranging from 30-meter to 250-m grid cells. In newer versions of FORE-SCE (&gt;2015) a framework of land ownership and management parcels is also used to treat contiguous grid cells within an ownership parcel as a single unit, thus mimicking land use decisions on the ownership units for which those decisions are applied.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Limitations, domain ranges: What is this model specifically NOT intended to do)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"FORE-SCE's strength is representation of scenario-based anthropogenic land use change. The model also represents changes in suitability to support those land uses in the future as future conditions change. Most notably, as climate and water availability changes, ability of a grid cell to support a given crop type will change. Note this dynamic relationship does NOT include potential changes in cultivars or other genetic improvements to crops that may result in adaptations to climate/water conditions. Note we can also only account for factors that have their own set of future projections.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Input/Output and Variables</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Key input parameters and their values and domain ranges and units (minimum input requirements for model operation and default values, where appropriate); control variables; Key output variables and domain ranges)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Primary inputs include current and historical land cover maps. Key ancillary input data include spatially explicit variables that can be used to characterize liklihood for a given grid cell to support a given land use. This typically includes variables on climate, soils, topography, water access, transportation networks, demographic information, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Input data are translated into key model parameters including probability surfaces for each land cover class, protected land status, and pixel history/age.</p>\n\n<p>Output data are primarily 1) land cover maps for historical and/or future dates and 2) grid cell histories, used to characterize things such as forest age. When run in Monte Carlo mode, output variables may also include grid-cell probability/frequency values, and mode land cover class.\"</p>\n\n<p>FORE-SCE also represents hypothetical changes in natural vegetation classes as future climate change. Distributions of those veg classes may change over time. Note however these changes represent hypothetical changes due to climate alone, and don't account for competition among veg classes/communities, changing impacts of disturbance, or influences of land management.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conditions</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Initial conditions)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"FORE-SCE is dependent upon a continuous, wall-to-wall land-cover product to establish initial conditions. Not only does that product serve as time \"\"t\"\" for model initiatlization (whether for historical backcasts, or for future projections), but those data are vitally important for establishing relationships between individual land cover classes, and spatially explicit driving forces of change. Those relationships are used to develop probability surfaces and other model elements vital for FORE-SCE parameterization.</p>\n\n<p>Current (and contemporary historical conditions) are currently primarily provided by three data sets: 1) NLCD, 2) LCMAP, and USDA's CDL.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Functions</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Forcing functions that affect the dynamics of the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Future projections are primarily driven by exogenous scenario inputs, which themselves are typically driven by a combination of socioeconomic forces, as well as climate.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of prescribed scenarios, FORE-SCE is also driven by forecast changes in biophysical variables related to climate and water availability. The suitability of the landscape to support individual land cover classes is dynamic, responding to projected changes in climate and ground/surface water availability.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;<em>(Provide sample runs that illustrate the dynamics of the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Many published model runs (and associated metadata) are available in ScienceBase, including:</p>\n\n<p>Sohl, T.L., Reker, Ryan, Bouchard, Michelle, Sayler, Kristi, Dornbierer, Jordan, Wika, Steve, Quenzer, Rob, and Friesz, Aaron, 2018, Modeled historical land use and land cover for the conterminous United States: 1938-1992: U.S. Geological Survey data release,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5066/F7KK99RR\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(51, 122, 183);\">https://doi.org/10.5066/F7KK99RR</a></p>\n\n<p>Sohl, T.L., Sayler, K.L., Bouchard, M.A., Reker, R.R., Friesz, A.M., Bennett, S.L., Sleeter, B.M., Sleeter, R.R., Wilson, T., Soulard, C., Knuppe, M., and Van Hofwegen, T., 2018.

Quantity disagreement measures how well the model matches overall reference land cover proportions. FORE-SCE is designed to precisely match a \"prescription\" for change, be it based on historical data for a historical backcast run, or on a scenario prescription for the future. Quantity disagreement is thus nearly always negligible. Allocation disagreement measures how well the model matches overall spatial allocation of change over space and time.
