MODFLOW-96 simulates steady and nonsteady flow in an irregularly shaped flow system in which aquifer layers can be confined, unconfined, or a combination of confined and unconfined. BRANCH simulates steady or unsteady flow in a single open-channel reach (branch) or throughout a system of branches (network)connected in a dendritic or looped pattern by solving the one-dimensional equations of continuity and momentum for the river flow. Channel-aquifer flows are leakage through a confining layer or riverbed. Computation of this leakage in the [...]",
