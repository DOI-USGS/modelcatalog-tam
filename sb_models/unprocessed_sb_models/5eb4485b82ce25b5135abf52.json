Although these MODFLOW versions are often based on the core version (presently MODFLOW-2005), there are often incompatibilities that restrict their use with one another. In many cases, development of these alternative versions has been challenging due to the underlying MODFLOW structure, which was designed for the simulation with a single groundwater flow model using a rectilinear grid.</p>\n\n<p>MODFLOW 6 is the latest core version of MODFLOW. It synthesizes many of the capabilities available in MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT, and MODFLOW-LGR. MODFLOW 6 was built on a new object-oriented framework that allows new packages and models to be added, and allows any number of models to be tightly coupled at the matrix level. The Groundwater Flow (GWF) Model is the first model to be released in MODFLOW 6. It supports regular MODFLOW grids consisting of layers, rows, and columns, but it also supports more flexible grids that may conform to irregular boundaries or have increased resolution in areas of interest. The GWF Model consists of the original MODFLOW stress packages (CHD, WEL, DRN, RIV, GHB, RCH, and EVT) and four advanced stress packages (MAW, SFR, LAK, and UZF), which have been distilled from their predecessors to contain the most commonly used capabilities. MODFLOW 6 contains a new Water Mover (MVR) Package that can transfer water from provider packages to receiver packages. Providers can be many of the stress and advanced stress packages; receivers can be any of the advanced stress packages. This new capability makes it possible to route water between lakes and streams, route rejected infiltration into a nearby stream, or augment lakes using groundwater pumped from wells, for example. To modernize user interaction with the program, the MODFLOW 6 input structure was redesigned. Within package input files, information is divided into blocks, and informative keywords are used to label numeric data and activate options. This new input structure was designed to make it easier for users to adjust simulation options in an intuitive manner, reduce user input errors, and allow new capabilities to be added without causing problems with backward compatibility.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Model Name</strong> <em>(Name of the model, including acronyms)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>A modular hydrologic model (MODFLOW 6)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model Version</strong> <em>(Version of the model, (i.e., 2.0))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>6.2.0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong> <em>(Description or summary of the model, including its purpose or goals and the type or formalism of the model (e.g., system dynamic, agent based model, machine learning), preferably accompanied by relevant keywords)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>MODFLOW is a popular open-source groundwater flow model distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey.
