Over the years since the release of Versions 1.0 through 1.4, various additions, modifications, and corrections have been made to the original simulator. Major changes included in Version 2 are (1) a revised data-input file with all spatial information described by coordinate location; (2) a new iterative solver for the matrix equations based on a generalized conjugate-gradient method; (3) an evapotranspiration boundary condition; (4) a division of the simulator output into many files; (5) a new set of output files designed for use by post-processing programs for graphical visualization and for flow [...]",

The post-processing program for graphical visualization must be supplied by the user. Version 2 of the simulator has been verified using five test problems selected from the published literature. One involves heat transport, four involve solute transport, and all have variable-density fluids.",
