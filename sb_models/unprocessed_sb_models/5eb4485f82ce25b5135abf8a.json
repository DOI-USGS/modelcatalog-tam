Generally, the program is easily installed on most computer systems.

Added a routine to deallocate memory for VDF variables. Corrected an MT3DMS programming error related to changes in water storage. Added suppport for MT3DMS recirculation wells.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Input/Output and Variables</strong> <em>(Key input parameters and their values and domain ranges and units (minimum input requirements for model operation and default values, where appropriate); control variables; Key output variables and domain ranges)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>In order to use SEAWAT, initial conditions, hydraulic properties, and stresses must be specified for every model cell in the finite-difference grid.</p>\n\n<p>Primary output is head and concentration, which can be written to the listing file or to separate binary files. Other output includes the complete listing of all input data, drawdown, flow budget, and transport budget data. Flow budget data are printed as a summary in the listing file, and detailed budget data for all model cells can be written into a separate file. All binary output is written to files that are opened with the FORM='BINARY' option. This means that some pre- and post-processors may not be able to read the output unless the open statements are modified, the program is recompiled, and the model is rerun.</p>\n",
