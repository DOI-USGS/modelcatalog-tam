The main program and all subroutines are written in Fortran 90. This distribution includes the original source code as well as executable files (Windows and Mac OS X) that can be run directly from the command line. Many of the supporting scripts are written in Python and run in version 2.7; with moderate editing, the user could get them to run under Python 3. Shell scripts (and equivalent Windows batch files) make up the remainder of the scripts. The Windows batch files also require Cygwin (Cygwin1.dll version 6.1 or later, <a href=\"https://cygwin.com/index.html\">https://cygwin.com/index.html</a>) and a package of Unix commands that have been ported to Windows (<a href=\"http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/\">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a>). We chose not to develop a graphical user interface because the program is usually run in batch mode. Consequently, we have provided example shell scripts and batch files that can be used to automate data processing with THRESH and integrate it with example Python scripts that demonstrate methods for data acquisition and plotting.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'System Requirements': <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2\">https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dependencies</strong> <em>(All data dependencies needed to run the model and replicate any published results)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Fortran source code can be compiled using freely available gfortran (<a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/\">http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/</a>) or any of the commercially available Fortran compilers that support Fortran 95.

First, download the archive file from the repository, extract the contents of the zip archive file to the desired location on your computer, and rename the top-level directory of the package thresh-master-/ to LandslideThresholds/. Throughout the remainder of this report, we will assume that the threshmaster-/ directory has been renamed and refer to it by the name LandslideThresholds/. We have provided compiled binary executable files for Mac OS X and Windows. After you have installed the LandslideThresholds/ folder, download the executables that are appropriate for your system and place them in the folder LandslideThresholds/bin/. The executable files can be accessed from the releases tab at <a href=\"http://github.com/usgs/landslides-thresholds/releases\">http://github.com/usgs/landslides-thresholds/releases</a>. Instructions for compiling the code for other systems are available in the code repository. Python version 2 (preferably Python 2.7.10 or later), including a number of Python libraries, must be installed on the system in order to run all of the scripts.

(e.g. [Growing Degree Days since Jan 1]+[Warm Spells]=[Leaf Out Day of Year] and [Growing Degree Days since Leaf Out Day of Year]+[Warm Spells]=[Bloom Day of Year]))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>See 'pseudo-code.txt': <a href=\"https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/landslide-thresholds/-/blob/master/doc/pseudo-code.txt\">https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/landslide-thresholds/-/blob/master/doc/pseudo-code.txt</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Equations</strong> (What are the equations of the model?):</p>\n\n<p>See \"equations 1-8': <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2\">https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2</a>\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Temporal Information</strong> <em>(Temporal resolution, time stepping, and units)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Temporal resolution and time stepping is determined by the resolution of the rainfall time-series input; units are typically mm/h or in./h\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spatial Information</strong> <em>(Spatial dimensionality, resolution, extent, grid type if relevant)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"THRESH operates on individual stations (points) which can be spaced arbitrarily. With appropriate preprocessing of satellite or radar rainfall estimates, the model could compute time-series of threshold conditions for arbitrary groups of pixels/grid cells.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Limitations</strong> <em>(Limitations, domain ranges: What is this model specifically NOT intended to do)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"The computer program, thresh, along with its accompanying utility programs and scripts, has two purposes: (1) the automated tracking of precipitation conditions, including forecasts, relative to empirical thresholds for landslide occurrence, and (2) analyzing precipitation for multi-year-long periods of record to compare historical threshold exceedance with dates of historical landslides. The program has been used to track rainfall conditions relative to landslide thresholds for the Seattle area (<a href=\"http://landslides.usgs.gov/monitoring/seattle/\">http://landslides.usgs.gov/monitoring/seattle/</a>) on a nearly continuous basis since about January 2006. The program was also used to analyze performance of rainfall thresholds for Seattle against historical records (Chleborad and others, 2006; 2008) and more recently for the Mukilteo and Everett area of Washington State (Scheevel and others, 2017). We have made improvements to the program and written documentation to prepare it for public release in support of our recent cooperation with Sound Transit to improve precipitation thresholds for the rail corridor near Mukilteo and Everett, Washington and to incorporate rainfall forecasts into precipitation tracking to enhance early warning for landslides.</p>\n\n<p>The program is written in a modular format for flexibility and expandability. The current version was designed for a few specific types of precipitation thresholds which include most types of thresholds that have been published for areas of the U.S. These include intensity-duration thresholds, cumulative recent-and-antecedent precipitation thresholds, and intensity thresholds based on a constant duration (running-average intensity thresholds and peak-intensity thresholds). Seasonal antecedent precipitation totals and the antecedent water index are both supported for use in areas where antecedent precipitation is known to affect validity of intensity-duration thresholds.</p>\n\n<p>An instance of thresh and related programs is limited to a specific geographic area for which thresholds can be defined. Operation is easily scaled to broader areas by running additional instances using threshold parameters and related input data customized for each additional locality or region of interest.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Purpose and limitations': <a href=\"https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/landslide-thresholds/-/tree/master\">https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/landslide-thresholds/-/tree/master</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Input/Output and Variables</strong> <em>(Key input parameters and their values and domain ranges and units (minimum input requirements for model operation and default values, where appropriate); control variables; Key output variables and domain ranges)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"The software distribution includes all the information and sample data necessary to run the programs. Applying the software to any specific problem requires (1) a source or sources of continuous time-series precipitation data in hourly or shorter increments and (2) one or more predefined precipitation thresholds for landslide occurrence of a type supported by the software. These include rainfall intensity-duration (ID) thresholds, cumulative recent-and-antecedent (RA) precipitation thresholds, running-average-intensity thresholds, and peak intensity thresholds. The software was designed to use input precipitation data collected at a specific point as from rain gages. Satellite or radar data might also be usable with appropriate calibration if converted to time series for specific geographic coordinates.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Input Requirements': <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2\">https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Conditions</strong> <em>(Initial conditions)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Initial conditions are assumed to be dry soil (no antecedent precipitation and no recent precipitation.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Functions</strong> <em>(Forcing functions that affect the dynamics of the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Rainfall time series data are the only forcing functions of the model.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong> <em>(Provide sample runs that illustrate the dynamics of the model)</em>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2\">https://doi.org/10.3133/tm14A2</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> <em>(Model evaluation, uncertainty, and sensitivity)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"Throughout its development, the code has passed through various kinds of testing to verify that it reproduces results of the basic formulas for rainfall thresholds (Chleborad and others, 2006, 2008; Baum and Godt, 2010) and correctly tracks precipitation sums and intensities in relation to the thresholds.
