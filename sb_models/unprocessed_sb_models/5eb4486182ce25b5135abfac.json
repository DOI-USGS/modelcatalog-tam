The model can analyze problems in one or two dimensions using either cartesian or radial coordinate systems. Relations between pressure head, moisture content, and relative hydraulic conductivity may be represented by functions developed by van Genuchten, Brooks and Corey, Haverkamp and others, or by data points. Initial hydraulic condition can be specified as static equilibrium, specified pressure head, or specified moisture content. Boundary conditions include specified pressure or total head, specified flux, infiltration with ponding, evaporation, plant transpiration, and seepage faces. Solute transport processes include advection, dispersion, first-order decay, adsorption, and ion exchange. VS2DH is a version of VS2DT that has been modified to simulate energy transport instead of solute transport. Both VS2DT and VS2DH are written in Fortran 90. Although these models are integrated into the graphical software package, their source codes are maintained as individual Fortran programs that can be compiled and run separately from the graphical user interface.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Abstract': <a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?vs2di(1)#:~:text=This%20software%20package%20consists%20of,saved%20from%20previous%20simulation%20runs\">https://water.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/man_wrdapp?vs2di(1)#:~:text=This%20software%20package%20consists%20of,saved%20from%20previous%20simulation%20runs</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Model Name</strong> <em>(Name of the model, including acronyms)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>VS2DI - A graphical software package for simulating fluid flow and solute or energy transport in variably saturated porous media</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model Version</strong> <em>(Version of the model, (i.e., 2.0))</em>:</p>\n\n<p>1.3</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong> <em>(Description or summary of the model, including its purpose or goals and the type or formalism of the model (e.g., system dynamic, agent based model, machine learning), preferably accompanied by relevant keywords)</em>:</p>\n\n<p>\"VS2DI is a graphical software package for simulating flow and transport in variably saturated porous media.

Initial conditions in terms of pressure heads or moisture contents for flow simulations and concentrations or temperatures for transport simulations are needed. Hydraulic and transport properties of the porous media are also required. These values can be different for different sediments. Flow simulations require values for saturated hydraulic conductivity and for relative hydraulic conductivity and moisture content as functions of pressure head. Solute transport simulations require values for dispersivity and molecular diffusion. Energy transport simulations require values for heat capacities of water and soil and thermal conductivity. Other information may be needed, depending on the program options that are selected.\"</p>\n\n<p>See 'Data Requirements': <a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/VS2DI/VS2DI_Summary.txt\">https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/VS2DI/VS2DI_Summary.txt</a></p>\n\n<p>\"The VS2DI software package was developed using a combination of Java, C, and Fortran programming languages. This software has run successfully on the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows XP, 2000, 98, and NT 4.0. For other computer platforms, the usability of VS2DI depends on the availability of a Java Development Kit for that platform, and the ability to compile Fortran and C programs into dynamic or shared libraries that can be used by the Java program.
