    "summary": "WSPRO computes water-surface profiles for subcritical, critical, or supercritical flow as long as the flow can be reasonably classified as one-dimensional, gradually-varied, steady flow.  WSPRO can be used to analyze:  (1) open-channel flow; (2) flow through bridges; (3) flow through culverts; (4) embankment overflow; and (5) multiple-opening (two or more separate bridge and (or) culvert structures) stream crossings.  WSPRO is designated HY-7 in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) hydraulics computer program series.  A primary objective in developing WSPRO was to provide bridge designers with a highly flexible tool for analyses of alternative bridge openings and (or) embankment configurations. However, WSPRO is equally flexible [...]",

However, WSPRO is equally flexible and suitable for analyses of existing stream crossings.&nbsp; Much of the model's flexibility can be attributed to the data input scheme which, to a great extent, is designed for unformatted, order-independent data.&nbsp; Additional flexibility is provided by propagation of constant data and limited capabilities for synthesizing cross sections.&nbsp; Also, many desirable features from other models were incorporated into WSPRO.&nbsp; The type and quantity of output is to a large extent user-specifiable.&nbsp; Thus WSPRO is a very easy-to-use model, which is generally applicable to water-surface profile analyses for highway design as well as for problems related to flood plain mapping, flood insurance studies, and estimating stage-discharge relationships.",
